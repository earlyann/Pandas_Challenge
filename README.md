Module 4 - Pandas Challenge

In this assignment, I took on the role of a Chief Data Scientist for a city's school district. I have created and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to help the school board and mayor analyze school and standardized test data to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

District Summary
This is a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, which include:
  - Total number of unique schools
  - Total students
  - Total budget
  - Average math score
  - Average reading score
  - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
  - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
  - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

School Summary
This DataFrame summarizes the key metrics about each school.
  - School name
  - School type
  - Total students
  - Total school budget
  - Per student budget
  - Average math score
  - Average reading score
  - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
  - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
  - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
  - This captures the top 5 schools by % Overall Passing in descending order 

Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
  - This captures the bottom 5 schools by % Overall Passing in descending order 

Math Scores and Reading Scores by Grade
  - Two DataFrames that lists the average math and reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th,       12th) at each school.

Scores by School Spending
  - Breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).

Scores by School Size
  - breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

Scores by School Type
  - This shows school performance based on the "School Type".
