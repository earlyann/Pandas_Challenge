## Project Overview

Exploring a csv of school data I have created a Python Pandas script to analyze the school and standardized test data to make strategic suggestions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

The result are several summaries that provide different looks at the data. The District Summary is a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, including # of schools, budget information and math and reading standardized scores. The School Summary
summarizes the key metrics about each school including # of students, budget per student and math and reading stanadrized score information. I also looked at the Highest-Performing Schools and Lowest-Performing Schools by % Overall Passing
