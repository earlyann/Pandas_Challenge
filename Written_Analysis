School Analysis

The data clearly shows that Charter schools drasically out perform District schools in both the math 
and reading standardized testing. 

It is notable that the District schools are much larger than the Charter schools, with all District
schools falling into the Large (2000-5000 student) category. The only outlier to that is the Charter
school, Wilson High School, as the only Charter school falling into the Large category. There is a
correlation here between school size and test results.

On average Charter schools spent less per student than District schools, so this is not a matter of 
budget. As it sits right now all the Charter and District schools spend similarly on students; with 
the per capita budget being within $100.

If we are to assume that larger schools have larger class sizes, one strong suggestion I would make 
to the board would be to look at reducing class sizes at the District schools. I would also recommend
looking at other cultural attributes of smaller schools that District schools could look to model. 
Examples might include: amount of green space vs building space available to students, support resources
outside of the class room offered by the school and down to even cafeteria options. We can leverage
the success of the Charter schools to show the way for the District schools.
